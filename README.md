# The Beats Index
# Creation of Index: 
The index creation occured in 10 stages
## Stage 1: Getting the Data
To begin my index project, I scraped the "https://themacindex.com/variants/MHA22/beats-pro?currency=USD" site which displayed the price of beats headphones for 34 countries around the world. It included the list price, price with refunds as well as the price in the country's local currency. 

I then used my scrape_table function which converts result set created by the beautiful soup function to into the table format.
